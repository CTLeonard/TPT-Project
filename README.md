## TPT-Project

The overall goal of the TPT project is to

- Identify common searches
- User path on TPT site

# Identifying common searches

By knowing what TPT's userbase is searching for, TPT will be able to produce or encourage more worksheets related to these searches. For example, knowing that many teachers were looking for Dr. Seuss worksheets on Dr. Seuss day, TPT can increase these number of worksheets. By having a greater selection, users may find one they like and purchase it.

# User path on TPT site

By visualizing a user or group of user's path on the TPT site, TPT will have a better idea of what parts of their site are utilized the most and which the least. A page that is frequently visited can have more links to paying items. Pages that are infrequently visited can suggest a re-work of the page to make it friendlier or suggest it's something TPT's userbase is not interested in.
